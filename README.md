# WooMinecraft - Self-hosted Minecraft Donations

[WooMinecraft](http://woominecraft.com) is a free Minecraft Donation plugin for your server that provides a self-hosted solution where you're the boss.  By leveraging a well known eCommerce plugin on the
WordPress side of things, we allow you to specify commands for product variations, general product commands, and resending of donations at any time.

## How does it work?
This bridges the gap between PHP, and Java by leveraging both the bukkit/spigot API ( java ) and the WordPress API with WooCommerce support ( php ). It stores commands
per order, per player, per command ( yes you read that right ) in the WordPress database.  This plugin, either when an op requests it, or on a timer, sends a request to
the WordPress server to check for donations for all online players.

If online players have commands waiting to be processed, then all necessary commands are ran.  There is NO LIMIT to the type of commands you can set, `give`, `i`, `tp`, etc... all commands are ran
by the console sender, and not a player.

## Contributions

As with all Github projects, we encourage our users to contribute, even if it's just a small as [opening an issue](https://github.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft).  Every little bit helps, especially with pre-releases
that may be unstable.

## Mojang Guidelines
Since this plugin is GPL and entirely opensource, we cannot be sure how you will use this. However, when providing 'donation' options, you are still considered a 
`commercial` entity and therefore are bound to the [Mojang Commercial Usage Guidelines](https://account.mojang.com/terms#commercial)

### WordPress Plugin
You'll need the WordPress plugin for this MC Plugin to work - you can [get it here](https://github.com/WooMinecraft/woominecraft-wp).
